Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
This map allows for real time bus tracking and interactive use. Transit date from MBTA is used in conjunction with Google Maps to display an area of the city and a specific bus route - in this case we are showing stops from MIT to Harvard.

## Future Enhancements
Tracking mulitiple buses and adding color-coded markers to show returning routes. Adjust for a different city.
